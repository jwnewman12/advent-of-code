# Advent of Code 2020

We'll see how far I go, usually I get to day 7 or 8 and get distracted.

I'll probably try to do all of them just in plain Node.js with no external
dependencies in one simple file. Node 14.3+ is required for top level await.

Use:

```console
$ node dayNN.mjs
```

to run.

I am not handling edge cases and making lots of assumptions, just trying to
find the 'best' approach and quickly move along.
